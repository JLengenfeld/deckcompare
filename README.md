The idea is to build a tool that can compare .o8d files containing decks from the card game Android: Netrunner.
Those deck lists can be found on http://netrunnerdb.com/ for example.

The first feature should be a collision dectection. That means an output of all cards that are used more than 3 times in total in two decks.
