Shout outs to LSK for this list. Tinkered the list to my liking and for speed/matchups, this is a deck I&#039;ve been playing consistently in GNK&#039;s and Stimhack League to great success. Changes are as follows:


Removed

2x Imp
1x Daily Casts
2x Queen&#039;s Gambit
1x Knifed

Added


2x Inject
2x Hacktivist Meeting
2x Turntable


Removed Imp due to predominance of CVS in the meta and clunky turn structures with Imp. Tag riding happens often so having Daily Casts sit with tags doesn&#039;t work. Queen&#039;s Gambit is literally a gambit I don&#039;t want to make a mistake on, and Knifed, although great, doesn&#039;t do much if I&#039;m going to be blowing up all the ICE.

Added Inject to move faster into Siphon pieces to combat the needed turn 2-4 aggression VS HB:EtF, alongside with Hackvtivist in a rez heavy meta. Turntable because I love EDM and taking Astro counters from my opponents.

Here are some links to success in tournaments I used this deck:

401 Games
Black Knight Games 1
Heroes World
Black Knight Games 2
Stimhack Finals 1
Stimhack Finals 2


Going into the Post MWL meta, I&#039;d probably just cut the Femme, and add a Inject to make this beast go faster. I barely use Femme as it is, and the deck has legs already to be such a threat overall. Hope you all enjoyed the finals!!]]></notes>
